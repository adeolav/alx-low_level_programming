Structures
C programming

A structure is a user defined data type available
in C that allows to combine data items of
different kinds.
Structure declaration
● You can define a structure in the global
scope of your program (outside of all your
functions, just like the functions
prototypes).
● You can declare elements of your structure
in its scope.
You can access the
elements of your
structure by using the ‘.’
symbol.

Pointers to structures
To access elements of a pointer to a
structure, you have to dereference the
pointer and then access to the data using
the ‘.’ symbol.
BUT
There is a simple way to do that, just by
using the ‘->’ symbol.
This symbol is equivalent to dereferencing
+ using
